## How to use

either:
- Clone the repository
- run `./python -m pymodorino.pymodoro`

or simply:
- `pip install pymodorino`
- `pymodorino`

- press 'q' to kill

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -w 25                Focus/work minutes. (default: 25m)
  -b 5                 Break minutes. (default: 5m)
  -s './oi.wav'        Wav file to use for the notifications. (default: ./oi.wav)
  ```
  
  ### Todo:
  - Refactor
  - Add more notification sounds (different sounds for break and working states)
  - add some statistics
  - (?)
